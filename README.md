DRC is the Data Recognition Corporation

eDirect is their web interface

In June 2015, NY State used them to collect data on the Geometry and ELA common core regents exams

The data files available for download from edirect had a few stupid features.  The most annoying is that all of the multiple choice responses are in a single variable, as are all of the constructed response scores.

This web app allows a user to upload a file taken from eDirect.  It then adds individual variables for the each item.  It also creates a <Last, First> name variable.
